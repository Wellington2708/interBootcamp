            <p>My name is Wellington Junior, I'm 37 years old. I am Brazilian, but I live in Portugal. I'm a student of System Development Technician at SENAC, where I am interested in becoming a Fullstack developer.
            This is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wellington-luis-41513874/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>, and I hope to make good connections through it.

            <p>
                I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and following the course methodology, I am progressing towards learning Java, TypeScript, and other programming languages.
                I also have knowledge of Agile methodologies, Clean Code, and the main programming language conventions.
                At the start of this project, my English level is A2, but I study daily to achieve fluency.

        <p>
            My goal with this Bootcamp is to learn as much as possible about web development, both front-end and back-end, to be able to build complete and functional web applications. I also want to improve my problem-solving skills and learn best practices in coding.
            Finally, this is a project for study purposes, therefore the structure of the folders and files may not be in the best architecture, as this specific repository will serve to record the knowledge acquired in the DIO Inter Bootcamp.
